# Series Prediction
It takes a series of numbers as input and then it tries to train the model based on that series pattern so that it could predict the successor of a term by using the very same logic.

<br/>
Series with the formula X<sub>n+1</sub>= (X<sub>n</sub> * 2)-3

<br/>
So here we got 35*2-3=67

<br/>

<br/>
Series with the formula X<sub>n+1</sub>= X<sub>n</sub> +2
<br/>
So here we got 13+2=15

<br/>
Series with the formula X<sub>n</sub>= X<sub>n</sub> <sup>2 </sup>
<br/>
So here we should get 7 <sup> 2</sup> = 49 but our model has predicted a very close result i.e 50.821
